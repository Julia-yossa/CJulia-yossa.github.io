    <p>I was <a>"born in a market"</a>,
      my father was a vendor and I was taught how to sell and count
      money at 6 years old during holidays.
      I was a shy kid then but took courage and toured the market
      with my sweets basket to complete my sales before 3 pm every weekday during holidays.
      When I was much older, I helped my dad sell fresh products at his market
      space,
      I acquired negotiation and client communication skills.</p>
