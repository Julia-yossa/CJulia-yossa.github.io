     <h2>Yosevents</h2>
     <p>This is the first ever project i had, late 2016. Frankly speaking, 
       i though at the time that by today i will be a millionaire. I guess i disnt have all the tools to succesfully build that company. 
       But i am sure soon, very soon things will change and yosevents will have a rebirth.</p>
      <h2>LEWA</h2>
      <p>Second project, but you know; 
        this kind of projects you want to run simultanuously but you 
        don't have the financial and manegerial means to get what you want. 
        Early 2017, i united a group of developpers and computer people so we could work on this project as final year students.
        we had meetings, it took us months, we even had a skeleton of webpage but when holidays came by, the team scattered and everyone headed seperate ways.
