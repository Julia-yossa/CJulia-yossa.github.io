    <div class="intro">
      <p>I am presently in incubation for the enable youth Cameroon program
        at the IITA Cameroon station and
        I am looking forward to exciting entrepreneurial challenges.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="standfirst">I have a bachelor’s degree Physics and a minor in computer science
      from the University of Buea. My business interest are new technologies, agriculture and
      renewable energy.</p>
       <p>Actually, I love technology and I am passionate about renewable energy,
          creating businesses, teaching and cooking. Apart from my computer abilities,
          event organisation and food processing are some more of my skills.
          Did I even mention I produce and, sell <a>flower and fruit syrups</a>,
          my specialities are Hibiscus and pineapple syrup, you can have a taste as
          from 1,000 FCFA <a href="">here</a>.
  
          Coming soon are wine and fruit petals ;).</p> 
          <p>Also, i partner with my sister in her brand <a>KYMH Beauty jewelry</a>. You can check our gallery, and buy 
            our exclusive bead accesories and jewelries <a>here</a>.</p>
    <p>I was <a>"born in a market"</a>,
      my father was a vendor and I was taught how to sell and count
      money at 6 years old during holidays. 
      I was a shy kid then but took courage and toured the market
      with my sweets basket to complete my sales before 3 pm every weekday during holidays.
      When I was much older, I helped my dad sell fresh products at his market
      space,
      I acquired negotiation and client communication skills.</p>
    <h3>JOBS</h3>
      <p>I had my first formal job at 16 years old,
      I worked for Terre et developpement, an NGO specialised in
      environmental development as rural plannificator.
      We spend 3 months in Banka community, west region of Cameroon
      collecting information using specific tools in villages.
      It was an enriching experience, I came to discover many aspects
      of village life and the challenges faced by the rural population.
      Team work and empathy was what I took from the most.</p>
    <p>The next job I had was a teaching job at King Solomon Anglo-Saxon
      section Ndi Samba, a private secondary school.
      I though physics and computer science to first cycle students.
      Enriching experience which lasted a trimester, it taught me a great deal of
      patience, planning and tolerance. After that, I had a part time surveyor
      job at Cible etudes et conseils. We had to survey customers of goods and
      services some companies offered.
      I worked on a total of 3 projects. </p>
    <h3>Volunteering</h3>
      <p>I have been a volunteer at <a href="">Le Petit prince et le Moabi</a> in 2018, an association which 
      acts toward the protection of mentally disabled children in Yaoundé. They conduct holiday camps during which they
      offers french sign laguage training, bead jewelry training, kitchen workshops, theatre workshops, music workshops and many other activities to 
      display the talents of kids both normal and different.
      My task was to take care of children, assiste animators and animate during breaks.
      It was a splendid experience, i had the opportunity to know more about mentally deficient kids, learn basic french sign language,
    take care of smaller ones and i learned theatre with some role play.</p>
      <p>Also, i have been a volunteer for the Ministry of Youth and civic education during the national launche of the Yout conneckt plateform. 
        My appointment was at the reception and orientation department. We to welcomed participants, registered them, directed them to the halls 
        and exposition venues. At the end of the day, we assisted the cleaning team in picking pappers. 
        It was an enriching experience, i felt the sense of serving my country and adding my little stone to the edifice.
