    <h2>ONGOING PROJECT</h2>
    <p><a href="getjy\index.html">JY FOODS</a> is the main project i am working on
      right now. Our main product is fruit and flower syrup for the local market.
      Made from whole fruits and flowers and conditioned in a germ free
      environment, we offer a taste of nature to our consumers.
      All you need is add water at convenience, can be used in desserts
      and cocktails for a priceless moment. Available flavours are hibiscus,
      pineapple, lime, ginger, mint, coffee and seasonal fruits.
      Online order is possible via <a href="../getjy/index.html">this site</a>  and free delivery
      is offered in Yaoundé as from 20 bottles ordered.</p>

    <p>We are currently prospecting farmers and seeking 
        funding for our soon to be established pepper 
        transformation unit. Monthly, we will provide 5 
        Tonnes of powder pepper to the global market.</p>
    
      <p>Also, we partner with KYMH Beauty jewelry, a Yaoundé based artist
          shop who offers bead made jewelries and accesories for beauties.
            you can have a look <a href="../kymh\index.html">here</a> and make commands

    <h2>FORMER PROJECTS</h2>
    <h2>Yosevents</h2>
    <p>This is the first ever project i had, late 2016. Frankly speaking,
      i though at the time that by today i will be a millionaire. I guess i disnt have all the tools to succesfully
      build that company.
      But i am sure soon, very soon things will change and yosevents will have a rebirth.</p>
    <h2>LEWA</h2>
    <p>Second project, but you know;
      this kind of projects you want to run simultanuously but you
      don't have the financial and manegerial means to get what you want.
      Early 2017, i united a group of developpers and computer people so we could work on this project as final year
      students.
      we had meetings, it took us months, we even had a skeleton of webpage but when holidays came by, the team
      scattered and everyone headed seperate ways.
